# Welcome
Building this blog is just a test of my techinal ability. But I will add more content in the future.

The world is in turmoil in 2020.
Time is continuous, 'a year' is actually just a number but not necessarily mean everything will change totally after 31th December.
But I merely wish after 365 day's blood circulation,
Flaming heart beats again with a short rest.

Conclude with the poem by *Louise Glück*

> afraid, yes, but among you again
>
>crying yes risk joy
>
>in the raw wind of the new world.

> 恐惧？
>
>是的。
>
>但同时，挨着从暴风新生的世界中。你的内心中也会腾生奋斗之喜

Hope you find your own new world.
